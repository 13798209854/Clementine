These are some really nasty shell scripts to merge the translations from
Launchpad (exported into bzr) into our svn repository.  Run init.sh once to
create "bzr" and "svn" folders, then run update.sh to update and merge them.

Be sure to check that:
  * You have all the dependencies for all the optional features installed,
    so code containing translatable strings isn't compiled out.
  * No shortcut modifiers (like "Ctrl+L") have been translated - the
    translations for these must always be in English.
  * No unexpected files have been added to svn.

There are versions of init.sh and update.sh for the website as well.
Updating the website needs a bit more manual work:
  * Update the LANGUAGES list in data.py.  These are the languages that get
    shown at the bottom of each page.
  * Make sure the LANGUAGE_NAMES entry for each new language is translated
    into that native language.
  * Don't commit any empty (or mostly empty) translations to svn.
